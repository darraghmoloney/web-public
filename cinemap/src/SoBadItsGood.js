  {id:0,title:"Glen or Glenda",year:1953,director:"Edward D. Wood Jr.",starring:"Edward D. Wood Jr., Bela Lugosi, Lyle Talbot",plot:"A psychiatrist tells two stories: one of a transvestite (Glen or Glenda), the other of a pseudohermaphrodite (Alan or Anne).",genre:"Drama",imdbscore:4.2,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0045826",
  why:"While we give this film props for tackling the taboo subject of cross-dressing and gender identity back in the 1950s, as is the case with most Ed Wood movies, there is more misdirection going on here than direction with a confusing plot and a nonsensical narrative."

  {id:1,title:"Plan 9 from Outer Space",year:1959,director:"Edward D. Wood Jr.",starring:"Gregory Walcott, Bela Lugosi, Mona McKinnon", plot:"Evil aliens attack Earth and set their terrible \"Plan 9\" in action. As the aliens resurrect the dead of the Earth to destroy the living, our lives are in danger.",genre:"Horror, Sci-Fi",imdbscore:4.0,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0052077",
  why:'Nonsensical plot, god-awful dialogue, near non-existent production values (a cardboard plane cockpit), continuity errors (a car arrives at a crime scene in daylight, yet the very next shot is set at night), and terrible directing (a cardboard tombstone in a cemetery tips over in full view) make this hilarious viewing, even if the laughs are in disbelief. \nWhen viewed after watching director Tim Burton’s 1994 movie Ed Wood, this movie is even more entertaining, especially if one believes the events in that movie to be true. '

  {id:2,title:"Flash Gordon",year:1980,director:"Mike Hodges",starring:"Sam J. Jones, Melody Anderson, Max von Sydow",plot:"A football player and his friends travel to the planet Mongo and find themselves fighting the tyranny of Ming the Merciless to save Earth.",genre:"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi",imdbscore:6.5,metacriticscore:58,imdbID:"tt0080745",
  why:'Over-the-top costumes, laughable dialogue, comical action sequences, and an epic soundtrack by Queen make this film a gloriously campy outing.  '

  {id:3,title:"Over the Top",year:1987,director:"Menahem Golan",starring:"Sylvester Stallone, Robert Loggia, Susan Blakely",plot:"Tough trucker Lincoln Hawk is determined to win back his son and triumph at the world arm wrestling championships.",genre:"Action, Drama, Sport",imdbscore:5.8,metacriticscore:40,imdbID:"tt0093692",
  why:'With Sylvester Stallone as the main character’s son, who wants to take part in an arm-wrestling championship, we get sequence after sequence of gloriously over-the-top machismo, making for one hilariously cheesy watch. '

  {id:4,title:"Masters of the Universe",year:1987,director:"Gary Goddard",starring:"Dolph Lundgren, Frank Langella, Meg Foster",plot:"The heroic warrior He-Man battles against the evil lord Skeletor and his armies of darkness for control of Castle Grayskull.",genre:"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",imdbscore:5.4,metacriticscore:35,imdbID:"tt0093507",
  why:'Frank Langella’s turn as villain Skeletor, including his “victory speech” is pretty much the acting highlight of the movie, even if that’s not saying much. '

  {id:5,title:"Mac and Me",year:1988,director:"Stewart Raffill",starring:"Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Ward, Tina Caspary",plot:"An alien trying to escape from NASA is befriended by a wheelchair-bound boy.",genre:"Adventure, Family,Sci-Fi",imdbscore:3.3,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0095560",
  why:'Both an unashamed rip-off of E.T. and glorified McDonald’s commercial, the movie has gained notoriety in recent years due to actor Paul Rudd’s running gag when on Conan O’Brien’s talk show “Conan” where he plays the hilarious scene of the wheelchair bound main character losing control of his wheelchair and falling into a lake, before the alien “Mac” (mysterious alien creature) saves him.  '

  {id:6,title:"Vampire's Kiss",year:1988,director:"Robert Bierman",starring:"Nicolas Cage, Maria Conchita Alonso, Jennifer Beals",plot:"After an encounter with a neck-biter, a publishing executive thinks that he's turning into a vampire.",genre:"Comedy, Horror",imdbscore:6.0,metacriticscore:31,imdbID:"tt0098577",
  why:'Nicolas Cage’s character’s mental breakdown is as awkward as it is hilarious, including his recital of the alphabet to his psychiatrist.'

  {id:7,title:"Troll 2",year:1990,director:"Claudio Fragasso",starring:"Michael Paul Stephenson, George Hardy, Margo Prey",plot:"A family vacationing in a small town discovers the entire town is inhabited by goblins in disguise as humans, who plan to eat them.",genre:"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror",imdbscore:2.9,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0105643",
  why:'Having no relation to the 1986 movie Troll, this movie’s acting must be seen to be believed, which was probably because the Italian film crew knew no English and couldn’t communicate to their American cast.'
  ,image: troll2},


  {id:8,title:"Samurai Cop",year:1991,director:"Amir Shervan",starring:"Robert Z'Dar, Mathew Karedas, Janis Farley",plot:"Joe Marshall and Frank Washington are two tenacious police detectives who seek at all costs to stop the Katana, a renegade Yakuza gang composed of violent and sadistic killers who want to lead the drug trade in Los Angeles.",genre:"Action, Crime, Thriller",imdbscore:4.6,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0130236",
  why:'Oh, where do we start with this one? That was the opinion shared by YouTuber Chris Stuckmann when he tried to review this movie. This movie seems more like a home movie made by a couple of friends that a distributed film.\n As well as shoddy production values and terrible action sequences, there is the fact that most off the supporting characters sound the same as the director couldn’t afford to get the actors back to redub their lines, as well as the main lead wearing a woman’s wig in some scenes as the actor cut his hair in between reshoots. '

  {id:9,title:"Demolition Man",year:1993,director:"Marco Brambilla",starring:"Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock",plot:"A police officer is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent nemesis who is loose in a non-violent future society.",genre:"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi",imdbscore:6.7,metacriticscore:34,imdbID:"tt0106697",
  why:'Wesley Snipes’ and Dennis Leary’s performances as an unhinged psychopath and a freedom fighter respectively. \nAccording to the movie, by the year 2032 all restaurants would be Taco Bell as according to Sandra Bullock’s character "Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the franchise wars." Things only get weirder from there … (the notorious three sea-shells scene, anyone?).'

  {id:10,title:"Street Fighter",year:1994,director:"Steven E. de Souza",starring:"Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul Julia, Ming-Na Wen, Kylie Minogue", plot:"Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts.",genre:"Action, Adventure, Comedy",imdbscore:3.9,metacriticscore:"N/A",imdbID:"tt0111301",
  why:'Raul Julia gives the final performance of his career as he died of cancer two months before the movie’s release. He reportedly took the role as his children were fans of the Street Fighter video game which the movie was based on. This means he gives the acting highlight of the film which if not for him would have just been in another bad video game adaptation. Did we mention it has Belgian action star Jean Claude Van Damme playing the American Colonel Guile?'

  {id:11,title:"Mortal Kombat",year:1995,director:"Paul W.S. Anderson",starring:"Christopher Lambert, Robin Shou, Linden Ashby",plot:"Three unknowing martial artists are summoned to a mysterious island to compete in a tournament whose outcome will decide the fate of the world.",genre:"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",imdbscore:5.8,metacriticscore:58,imdbID:"tt0113855",
  why:'Arguably one of the more enjoyable movies based off a video game, it is far more enjoyable than its sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997).\nLinden Ashby’s pompous movie star character Johnny Cage gets some classic one-liners. While fighting a bad guy who breaks his sunglasses, Cage informs him: “Those were $500 sunglasses, a**hole.”\nHere’s a fun drinking game, take a shot each time bad guy Shang Tsung sits down or stands up before, during or after a fight. Hopefully you’ll be ready for a night out by the time the movie is over.'

  {id:12,title:"Anaconda",year:1997,director:"Luis Llosa",starring:"Jon Voight, Jennifer Lopez, Eric Stoltz",plot:"A \"National Geographic\" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest - and deadliest - snake.",genre:" Action, Adventure, Horror",imdbscore:4.8,metacriticscore:37,imdbID:"tt0118615",
  why:'It’s a cheesy 90s creature-feature, where Jon Voight gives a hilariously hammy performance as a Paraguayan snake hunter with a strange accent.'
  ,image: anaconda},


  {id:13,title:"Con Air",year:1997,director:"Simon West",starring:"Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich",plot:"Newly paroled ex-con and former U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. ",genre:"Action, Crime, Thriller",imdbscore:6.9,metacriticscore:52,imdbID:"tt0118880",
  why:'Con Air would be pretty much any cheesy 90s action movie, except it has the following: John Malkovich’s deliciously evil turn as bad guy “Cyrus the Virus”; and Nicolas Cage’s southern accent and GLORIOUS locks.'
  ,image: conair},


  {id:14,title:"Dante's Peak",year:1997,director:"Roger Donaldson",starring:"Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, Jamie Renée Smith",plot:"A vulcanologist arrives at a countryside town recently named the second most desirable place to live in America, and discovers that the long dormant volcano, Dante's Peak, may wake up at any moment.",genre:"Action, Adventure, Thriller ",imdbscore:5.9,metacriticscore:43,imdbID:"tt0118928",
  why:'Pierce Brosnan gives a super cool performance as volcanologist in this CGI extravaganza that is streets ahead of 1997’s Volcano.'
  ,image: dantespeak},


  {id:15,title:"Face/Off",year:1997,director:"John Woo",starring:"John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen",plot:"In order to foil a terrorist plot, an FBI agent undergoes a facial transplant surgery and assumes the identity and physical appearance of a terrorist, but the plan turns from bad to worse when the same terrorist impersonates the FBI agent.",genre:"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi",imdbscore:7.3,metacriticscore:82,imdbID:"tt0119094",
  why:'It answers the age-old question of what happens when you put two overacting performances in one room, which is exactly what happens when both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage’s characters meet up in one scene.\nIt’s also a lot of fun to see both actors “pretend to be each other’s character”, leading to some gloriously over the top performances from both actors.'
  ,image: faceoff},


  {id:16,title:"Bad Boys II",year:2003,director:"Michael Bay",starring:"Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Gabrielle Union",plot:"Two loose-cannon narcotics cops investigate the flow of Ecstasy into Florida from a Cuban drug cartel.",genre:"Action, Comedy, Crime",imdbscore:6.6,metacriticscore:38,imdbID:"tt0172156",
  why:'While by no means a masterpiece, this action movie features a committed performance from stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, as well as over-the-top action sequence that you would expect from a Michael Bay movie.'
  ,image: badboys2},


  {id:17,title:"The Room",year:2003,director:"Tommy Wiseau",starring:"Tommy Wiseau, Juliette Danielle, Greg Sestero",plot:"Johnny is a successful banker who lives happily in a San Francisco townhouse with his fiancée, Lisa. One day, inexplicably, she gets bored with him and decides to seduce his best friend, Mark. From there, nothing will be the same again.",genre:"Drama",imdbscore:3.7,metacriticscore:9,imdbID:"tt0368226",
  why:'The film basically has the plot of a basic soap opera episode, the main character’s fiancée, or “future wife” as she is referred to in this film, decides she bored of their relationship and cheats on him with his best friend. However, what makes The Room, or the “Citizen Kane of Bad Movies” so good is the many unresolved plot points, such as a character’s mysterious breast cancer diagnosis, that appear and disappear throughout the film. Among many of the film’s strange detours is a nonsensical sequence in which the main characters play a game of “Tuxedo Football”.\nThe movie’s writer/producer/director/star Tommy Wiseau (Wiseau is credited at the start for all four) gives a performance so bad, he makes his wooden co-stars look natural by comparison. At times this performance becomes fascinating in its awfulness.'

  {id:18,title:"The Wicker Man",year:2006,director:"Neil LaBute",starring:"Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Leelee Sobieski",plot:"A sheriff investigating the disappearance of a young girl from a small island discovers there's a larger mystery to solve among the island's secretive, neo-pagan community.",genre:"Horror, Mystery, Thriller",imdbscore:3.7,metacriticscore:36,imdbID:"tt0450345",
  why:'Nicholas Cage’s gloriously over-the-top performance (who can forget the “Not the Bees” scene). \nAn over-reliance on cheap jump scares as well as terrible dialogue (How’d it get burned?!) make this horror film an unintentionally laugh-out-loud comedy.'
  ,image: wickerman},


  {id:19,title:"The Happening",year:2008,director:"M. Night Shyamalan",starring:"Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo",plot:"A science teacher, his wife, and a young girl struggle to survive a plague that causes those infected to commit suicide.",genre:"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi",imdbscore:5.0,metacriticscore:34,imdbID:"tt0949731",
  why:'Mark Wahlberg and his “confused-wimp” performance, as was described by YouTube personality Nostalgia Critic.\nA laughably bad twist ending, which also involves Wahlberg’s character literally talking to a tree.'
