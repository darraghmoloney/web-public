,critic:"Colin Kennedy, Empire", comment:"Glitter's rhyming slang is well earned. At times during the first hour of this 'rags to riches' story, Glitter appears to be the world's first Zen movie.

,critic:"Kirk Honeycutt, Hollywood Reporter", comment:"All the spunk and spirit of [Guy Ritchie's] first two box office hits, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" are missing from \"Swept Away,\" a movie so dangerously adrift from any artistic or commercial moorings that one cannot make out what is intended."

,critic:"Manohla Darghis, The Times", comment:"Nearly as unwatchable as it is unpronounceable. The pair should reconsider working with anyone who thought well of a movie hinged on jokes about the disabled, switch-hitting lesbians, and the sight of a dead man's brain splattered across an aquarium."

,critic:"Ellen Fox, Chicago Tribune", comment:"That's the thing about children when it comes to movies: They're not that discriminating. They can be perilously easy to please, which is why it's important that their parents protect them from films like Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2."
