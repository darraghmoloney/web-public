# Mobile Store Site

A prototype online mobile phone store website.

Uses mongoDB cloud for the database, Express for REST API routing with node.js for controllers.

The front-end is built with Bootstrap, Handlebars and jQuery.

Please note that the mongoDB connection will **NOT** work as the url in config/connect.js has been removed for security reasons. The code is otherwise left as is for demonstration.
